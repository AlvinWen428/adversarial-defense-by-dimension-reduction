### modified (batch norm. added in each cnn layer)
```python
        # 1-1 conv layer
        tnn.Conv3d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
        tnn.BatchNorm3d(64),
        tnn.ReLU(),

        # 1-2 conv layer
        tnn.Conv3d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
        tnn.BatchNorm3d(64),
        tnn.ReLU(),

```
